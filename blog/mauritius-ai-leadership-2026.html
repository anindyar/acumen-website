      <p class="lead">This February, I had the privilege of traveling to Mauritius to deliver an executive workshop on Generative AI for business leaders. Hosted at Kalis Investment in Port Louis, the event brought together CEOs, IT leaders, investors, and government representatives for an afternoon of demystification, live demonstrations, and strategic planning.</p>

      <h2>Why Mauritius, Why Now?</h2>

      <p>Mauritius occupies a unique position in the global economy. As a bridge between Africa, Asia, and Europe, the island nation has built its reputation on financial services, tourism, and increasingly, technology. The government's push toward becoming a digital hub makes this the perfect moment to discuss AI adoption at the leadership level.</p>

      <p>The event, titled <strong>"Understanding GenAI for Effective Leadership"</strong>, was designed specifically for decision-makers who need to cut through the hype and understand what AI can actually do for their organisations today — not in some distant future.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-info">
        <h4>Event at a Glance</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Date:</strong> 18 February 2026</li>
          <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Kalis Investment, Port Louis</li>
          <li><strong>Audience:</strong> ~45 executives, investors, and government officials</li>
          <li><strong>Format:</strong> Live demos + interactive workshop</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Session 1: GenAI Demystified</h2>

      <p>The first half of the workshop focused on cutting through terminology confusion. In boardrooms around the world, I've seen "AI," "GenAI," and "Agentic AI" used interchangeably — which leads to misaligned expectations and poor investment decisions.</p>

      <p>We started with clarity:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traditional AI</strong> — Pattern recognition, classification, prediction</li>
        <li><strong>Generative AI</strong> — Creating new content: text, code, images, analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Agentic AI</strong> — Autonomous systems that can plan, execute, and adapt</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The live demonstrations were where things got interesting. I showed attendees an AI assistant managing email, calendar, and browser simultaneously. We went from a rough prompt to a polished presentation in under five minutes. We analysed contracts and codebases in seconds.</p>

      <p>The room's energy shifted visibly. These weren't theoretical capabilities — they were tools I use daily in my own work.</p>

      <h2>Session 2: From Idea to Production</h2>

      <p>The second half was entirely hands-on. I asked the audience for a real business problem they wanted solved — and we built a working solution together, live on stage.</p>

      <p>This is where most AI workshops fail. They show polished demos of pre-built solutions. They don't show the messy, iterative reality of building with AI. I wanted these leaders to see exactly what the process looks like: the prompting, the debugging, the refinement, the deployment.</p>

      <p>By the end of the session, we had a functional application running in production — built entirely through conversation with AI, with the audience guiding the requirements.</p>

      <h2>The First 90 Days Framework</h2>

      <p>We closed with practical strategy. Every organisation is at a different stage of AI readiness, but the first 90 days of any AI initiative tend to follow similar patterns:</p>

      <h3>Days 1-30: Discovery</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Audit existing workflows for AI opportunities</li>
        <li>Identify quick wins vs. strategic investments</li>
        <li>Assess data readiness and governance gaps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Days 31-60: Pilots</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch 2-3 focused pilot projects</li>
        <li>Measure actual impact, not theoretical potential</li>
        <li>Build internal champions and skeptic-converters</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Days 61-90: Scale</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Codify learnings into repeatable playbooks</li>
        <li>Establish governance that enables rather than blocks</li>
        <li>Plan the next wave of initiatives</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sovereign AI: A National Imperative</h2>

      <p>One topic that resonated particularly strongly was sovereign AI — the idea that nations and enterprises need to control their own AI destiny rather than depending entirely on foreign cloud providers.</p>

      <p>For a country like Mauritius, with ambitions to become a regional technology hub, this isn't just a technical consideration. It's a matter of economic independence, data sovereignty, and long-term strategic positioning.</p>

      <p>We discussed practical approaches: local LLM deployment, hybrid cloud architectures, and building domestic AI talent. The interest from government representatives in the room was palpable.</p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>

      <p>This visit marks a deeper commitment from Acumen Labs to the African and Indian Ocean region. We're exploring partnerships that will bring more workshops, training programs, and hands-on AI implementation support to organisations ready to move beyond the hype.</p>

      <p>If you're a leader looking to understand what AI can actually do for your organisation — not in theory, but in practice — reach out. The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.</p>
